    "Though we will want more elaborate series of commands to codify our visualization of these RBD structures colored by escape, the series of commands below, when executed in a `PyMol` session with one of these PDBs open, will color the RBD surface according to escape scores.\n",

    "Alternatively, it might be worth it to take a weighted average of the escape fractions for each condition within in a given group. This might be important because some (noisy) sera have relatively high escape fractions across the entire RBD. We currently show these as flat escape profiles in the logo plots, with ylims that are calculated according to specs in the `escape_profiles_config.yaml` file. These ylims are saved to an output CSV file in the `results/escape_profiles/` subdirectory, so it would be possible to normalize to that y-max value before averaging. This may not be necessary, so we should see how it looks first. \n",

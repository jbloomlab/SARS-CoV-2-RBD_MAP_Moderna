# Experimental Data and Results for Moderna serum samples

These are the non-escape mapping experiments performed for this project. 
They include ELISAs and neutralization assays. 

All raw data are in the [./data/](data/) directory.

Results are in the [./results/](results/) directory.

The [./Moderna_sample_parsing.ipynb](Moderna_sample_parsing) notebook links each sample's random barcode to the more sensible sample names, such as `M01`, `M02`, ..., `M23`.

The [./mutant_neuts_config.yaml](mutant_neuts_config.yaml) notebook analyzes the neutralization assays that Allie Greaney, Andrea Loes, and  Lauren Gentles performed. 

The [./rbd_depletions.ipynb](rbd_depletions.ipynb) notebook analyzes the experiments that deplete RBD-binding antibodies from sera and determines what fraction of the neutralizing potency of sera from mRNA-1273-vaccinated individuals is derived from RBD-binding antibodies.
